# The Role of RealVNC in Our Robotics Project

## What is RealVNC?

RealVNC is a remote desktop application that allows us to access and control the Raspberry Pi from another device, such as a laptop.  
It creates a virtual desktop environment so we can work on the Raspberry Pi without needing a direct monitor, keyboard, or mouse connection.  

In our project, RealVNC made it possible to control and program the Raspberry Pi wirelessly, improving mobility and ease of development.

## Why RealVNC is Vital to Our Project

### Remote Access
- Allowed us to open and run applications on the Raspberry Pi (like Geany and terminal) directly from our laptops.  
- Eliminated the need to carry an extra display, keyboard, or mouse during testing.  

### Wireless Flexibility
- Connected over the same Wi-Fi network, enabling seamless control of the Raspberry Pi during robot testing.  
- This saved time and made our development setup portable.  

### File Transfer and Collaboration
- Provided an easy way to copy files between the Raspberry Pi and development machines.  
- Enabled our team to collaborate efficiently while working on different modules.  

### Secure and Reliable
- RealVNC offered password-protected access and encrypted connections, ensuring safe control of our Raspberry Pi.  

## Applications of RealVNC in Our Project

- **Remote Coding** – Running Python scripts and debugging the robot’s code directly from a laptop.  
- **Camera Feed Monitoring** – Viewing real-time Pi Camera output during testing.  
- **System Control** – Managing Raspberry Pi settings and processes without physical access.  
- **Collaboration** – Team members could connect and share the same Raspberry Pi environment remotely.  

## Conclusion

RealVNC greatly simplified our workflow by providing wireless access to the Raspberry Pi.  
It reduced hardware clutter, supported remote debugging, and allowed us to seamlessly integrate coding and testing into our robotics project.
