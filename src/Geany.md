# The Role of Geany in Our Robotics Project

## What is Geany?

Geany is a lightweight, fast, and easy-to-use Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports multiple programming languages.  
It is especially useful for editing and running Python scripts on the Raspberry Pi.  

In our project, Geany helped us develop and test Python code for camera input, computer vision (OpenCV), and integration with the ESP32 microcontroller.

## Why Geany is Vital to Our Project

### Lightweight and Fast
- Geany runs smoothly on the Raspberry Pi 5 without using heavy system resources.  
- This made it ideal for quick coding, testing, and debugging in real time.  

### Python-Friendly
- Provides syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and error hints for Python.  
- Helped us write and maintain code for cube detection, line following, and Pi–ESP32 communication.  

### Easy Execution
- Code can be written and executed directly within Geany.  
- Reduced the need for command-line runs, making development faster.  

### Customizable
- Plugins and settings allowed us to adapt Geany to our workflow.  
- Its simplicity made it beginner-friendly while still powerful enough for advanced tasks.  

## Applications of Geany in Our Project

- **Computer Vision** – Writing Python code with OpenCV for detecting cubes and lines.  
- **Communication** – Developing serial communication scripts between Raspberry Pi and ESP32.  
- **Testing** – Running motor control logic, debugging ultrasonic integration, and monitoring outputs.  
- **Rapid Prototyping** – Quickly modifying and re-running Python programs during field tests.  

## Conclusion

Geany was a reliable development environment on our Raspberry Pi, allowing us to build and test the Python code that powers our robot.  
Its lightweight design and simplicity made coding efficient, while still offering powerful features for debugging and project development.
