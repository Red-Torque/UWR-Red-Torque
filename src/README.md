# The Role of Fusion 360 in Our Robotics Project

## What is Fusion 360?

Fusion 360 is a cloud-based 3D CAD, CAM, and CAE software developed by Autodesk.  
It brings together design, simulation, and manufacturing tools in one platform, making it ideal for creating detailed 3D models.

In our project, Fusion 360 helped us design the robotâ€™s chassis, mounts, and other mechanical parts. It allowed us to model quickly and precisely, making 3D design and prototyping much easier.

## Why Fusion 360 is Important to Our Project

1. Accurate 3D Modeling  
   Fusion 360 allowed us to create precise models of the chassis and mounts, ensuring correct dimensions for all components.

2. Ease of Use  
   Its simple interface made it easy to test and improve designs quickly.

3. Collaboration  
   Being cloud-based, it allowed the team to share and edit files without issues.

4. Manufacturing Integration  
   Files could be exported directly for 3D printing, CNC, and laser cutting, reducing mistakes between design and production.

## Applications in Our Robot

- Designed the chassis to hold all components securely and keep balance  
- Built custom mounts for the Raspberry Pi, ESP32, sensors, and battery  
- Planned wiring paths to avoid tangling and interference  
- Tested multiple versions of the frame before finalizing the print

## Benefits of Using Fusion 360

- Precision in measurements and design  
- Faster modeling and prototyping  
- Easy teamwork and file sharing  
- Direct compatibility with 3D printers and fabrication tools

## Workflow in Our Project

1. Designed the chassis and mounts in Fusion 360  
2. Simulated and checked alignment and fit  
3. Exported files as `.f3d`, `.step`, or `.stl`  
4. Used them directly for 3D printing and CNC machining
